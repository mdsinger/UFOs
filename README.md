The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage in html using java script to build tables and retrieve data. The webpage needs to be filterable by different criteria (date, city, state, etc.). 

## Results

Someone can use this webpage to search for different UFO sightings to get more information about them. They can filter by date, city, state, country, and shape of sighting. The filters look like this:

Once the filters have been entered, the data will refresh to show the selected filtered data and the user can read the comments about the specific UFO sightings they are interested in.

## Summary

One drawback to this design is that it is not dynamic, meaning users cannot input their own sightings into the database. One recommendations for further improvements would be to allow users to submit their own UFO siting information. Another recommendation would be to have an option for visitors to click on a siting if they also witnessed the UFO and each siting would have a count on it based on users clicking that they had also seen it.
